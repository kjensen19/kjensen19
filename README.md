- Hi, I’m Kyle. 
- I’m interested in solving interesting puzzles, and finding new and unexpected ways to do things.
- I’m currently working in JS/Node, Go, Python/Django(REST), React, Angular(Typescript), Nextjs, or whatever else strikes my fancy!
- I'm open to frontend, backend, or fullstack opportunities. 
- I can be reached at kjensen19@gmail.com.
